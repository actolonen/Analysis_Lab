# Protocol to clean the HPLC column with ACN and isopropanol

## Clean column
* Run 5% ACN in 5 mM H2SO4 as mobile phase for 4h 
* Run 30% ACN in 5 mM H2SO4 as mobile phase for 4h

## Regenerate column
* Run 25 mM H2SO4 until RI signal stable (overnight)

  ## Autopurge
* Push "purge autosampler" to inject propanol into the system. Button in LabSolution. 10% propanol bottle is already online.
* Run mobile phase (5 mM H2SO4) until stable, generally around ~1h
* Push "Turn on the RID (Detector B).R Flow on/off". Change status of RID so both tubes are washed with same solution.
