# Protocol to clean the HPLC column with ACN and isopropanol

* Clean column
        Ran 5% ACN in 5 mM H2SO4 for 4h (deletes this step)
        Ran 30% ACN in 5 mM H2SO4 for 24h (~4-5h)
    Regenerate column
        Ran 25 mM H2SO4 until RI signal stable (overnight)
    Autopurge
        Push "purge autosampler" to inject propanol into the system. Button in LabSolution. 10% propanol bottle is already online.
    Run mobile phase (5 mM H2SO4) (run until stable, generally around ~1h)
    Push "Turn on the RID (Detector B).R Flow on/off". Change status of RID so both tubes are washed with same solution.
