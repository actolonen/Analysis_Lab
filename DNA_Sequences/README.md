# DNA sequence analysis

This is a collection of methods we commonly use for DNA sequence analysis.

1.  [Clustering](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Genome_Sequences/Clustering) of sequences using hierarchial and K-means clustering.
2.  [CRISPR site identification](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/DNA_Sequences/CRISPR_Sites) in a genome sequence.
3.  [Codon optimization](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/DNA_Sequences/Codon_Optimization) of a DNA sequence for DNA synthesis and expression in a host of interest.
