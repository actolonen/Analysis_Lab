# Analysis_Lab
This repo is a collection of methods we use in lab to study the physiology, metabolisms, and genetics of microorganisms. It is organized into 5 project areas:

1. [Growth](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Growth) of cells in microplates, culture tubes, and fermenters.
2. [DNA sequence analysis](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Genome_Sequences) of genomes.
3. [Gene expression analysis](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Gene_Expression) of transcriptomes and proteomes.
4. [Enzyme biochemistry](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Enzymes) of key steps in metabolism.
5. [Metabolic products](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Metabolites) of cultures.
