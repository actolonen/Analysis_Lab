# Analysis_Lab
This repo is a collection of methods we use in lab to study the physiology, metabolisms, and genetics of microorganisms. It is organized into 4 project areas:

1. [Growth](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Growth) of microorganisms in microplates, culture tubes, and fermenters.
2. [DNA sequence analysis](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Genome_Sequences) of microbial genomes.
3. [Gene expression analysis](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Gene_Expression) of transcriptomes and proteomes.
4. [Metabolic products](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Metabolites) of microbial cultures.
