# Analysis_Lab
This repo is a collection of methods we use in lab to study the physiology, metabolisms, and genetics of microorganisms. It is organized into 5 project areas:

1. [Growth](Growth) of cells in microplates, culture tubes, and fermenters.
2. [DNA sequence analysis](DNA_Sequences) of genomes.
3. [Gene expression analysis](Gene_Expression) of transcriptomes and proteomes.
4. [Enzyme biochemistry](Enzymes) of key steps in metabolism.
5. [Metabolic products](Metabolites) of cultures.
