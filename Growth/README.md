# Microbial Growth Analysis 

## Growth media
We cultivate microbial cells using various growth media that are prepared using these [protocols](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/blob/main/Growth/Media_Recipes).

## Measuring microbial growth at different scales: from microliters to liters.
We measure microbial growth at different volumetric scales using these methods:

 * [Microplates](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Growth/Microplates) to measure cultures of a few hundred microliters.
 * [Fermenters](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/tree/main/Growth/Fermenters) to measure cultures of 2-5 liters.
