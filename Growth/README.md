# Microbial Growth Analysis

## Plot growth curves from different instruments
In our lab at Genoscope, we grow cells using various types of media that we prepare using these [media recipes](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/blob/main/Growth/Media_Recipes).

We primarily measure microbial growth using two instruments: a [Bioscreen C](https://www.bioscreen.fi/) and a [CLARIOstar microplate reader](https://www.bmglabtech.com/en/clariostar-plus/). The Bioscreen only measures absorbance, but can read 2x100 well, custom honeycomb plates at the same time with temperature control. The Bioscreen is also well-adapted for anaerobic cultures because the wells can contain 500 ul mediuum. The CLARIOstar uses standard, 96 well plates and can measure both absorbance and fluorescence. 

Below are methods to extract and plot growth curves from the files produced by these two instruments. Both scripts read the data from .xlsx files in the format generated by the machine. To associate wells with treatment information, both scripts read the plate map from an "Information" page of the .xlsx file Here is an [example Bioscreen file](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/blob/main/Growth/Data/01-1Alba_2CphyWT_different_butanol_24mars16.xlsx) and [example Clario file](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/blob/main/Growth/Data/01_Courbe_de_croissance_WT-GM3_butanol_clario_04_12_2023.xlsx)

In addition to plotting the growth curves for different treatments, these scripts also calculate growth paramaters (e.g. intrinsic growth rate, generation time, carrying capacity) using the Growthcurver R package as described [here](https://github.com/actolonen/Analysis_Lab/blob/main/Growth/Logistic_Fit/2024.02_growthcurver.md).
