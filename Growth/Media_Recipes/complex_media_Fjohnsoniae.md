# Complex media for growth of *Flavobacterium johnsoniae*

Recipes from Thierry Doan

## CYE medium (1 liter)

-   10 g bacto-casitone (amino acids = pancreatic digestion of casein (milk phospho-protein))

-   5 g yeast extract

-   8 mM MgSO4 (1 g of MgSO4-7H2O per L)

-   10 mM Tris pH 7.5

Add 15 g/L agar to make plates

See J. Bacteriol 178:583-590. Most rapid growth but weak motility and spreading.

## PY2 medium (1 liter)

-   2 g peptone (enzymatic digest of protein (soy or milk solids))

-   0.5 g yeast extract

-   adjust to pH 7.3

Add 10 g/L agar to make plates

See Proc Ntl Acad Sci 94:12139-12144. Excellent spreading on plate. but low yield. Best for isolating mutants that do not glide. 

## MM medium (1 liter)

-   3.3 g Bacto-casitone

-   1.7 g Yeast extract

-   3.33 mM Tris pH 7.5

See J. Bacteriol. 189:7503-7506. Excellent for gliding motility and microscopy but low yield. It is in fact CYE without supplemental magnesium, diluted (1 part to 2 parts water).
